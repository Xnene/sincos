# 🎯 SinCos – Interactive Unit Circle Visualizer

This project visualizes trigonometric functions on the **unit circle** using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript. It's designed for educational use in math classes or for self-study, with support for both **Czech** and **English**.

## 🌐  Multilingual support / Vícejazyčná podpora

- [🇬🇧 English](README.en.md)

## 🔍 Features

- **Interactive unit circle** with X and Y axes
- Real-time angle control via input (0–360°)
- Visualization of trigonometric functions:
  - ✅ `sin(θ)` – green
  - ✅ `cos(θ)` – blue
  - ✅ `tan(θ)` – orange (vertical line from X-axis intersection)
  - ✅ `cot(θ)` – purple (horizontal line from Y-axis intersection)
- Extended **angle ray** beyond the circle to visualize intersections
- Displays function values with 3D-colored dots
- Converts angle into **π-form** (e.g., π/4)
- Supports **language switching** (CZ/EN)
